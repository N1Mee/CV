I am a *hardworking* student, who is always ready to stay after classes and complete an extra task. For the last few years I didn't even have proper holidays due to me being and olympiad participant in English Language. While my classmates were relaxing on their holidays and being couch potatoes, I was attending school in the morning and stayed there for *4 hours*.

* My time management is great.
    + Even though I always have a lot work to do, I have planned all of it out perfectly, so I manage to do everything and still get the right amount of rest, which is necessary, since otherwise my productivity will drop drastically
* My leadership skills are on a high level.
    + I am capable of being a good leader. I have done many courses in this sphere. When we get a task to be done in teams in school, I always tend to be the leader of the group.
* My code knowledge is exceptional.
    + I have been studying code for over *2 years* now and I'm not planning to stop. I know **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and I am targeting to learn **Node.js** and **React** in the near future
